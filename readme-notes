The very vast majority of javascript and jQuery is contained under lib/Scripts/JSFunctions.js.

The setup of this project is mainly giving divs classes and IDs and selecting them via jQuery, calling a php script under root/ajaxFunctions.php
and passing along something in the querystring to decide which query to run and return. After something is returned, we populate it with a callback function
in the ajax method. That is how most of the project is built.

Some php methods that are to be called over and over (not via ajax) are declared as static methods under lib/PHP/functions.php (such as thumbnail rendering)


In ajaxFunctions, under action == "displaybyid" we set a ?123 after the newly updated pic, this is to display the new image because if we don't have some new identifier, the old image
is cached and will continue to display. However; if we update an item after giving it a new image, sometimes it'll glitch out and go back. Need a more graceful way of handling this.
Maybe a timestamp after the image?
